<p>The Natural Language Classifier analyzes a string of text and assigns predefined categories to it by applying deep-learning technology.</p>
<p>Deep learning is based on a relatively recent set of approaches that use algorithms with similarities to the way the human brain works. Deep-learning algorithms offer state-of-the-art approaches in image recognition and speech recognition, and the Natural Language Classifier now applies them to text classification.</p>
