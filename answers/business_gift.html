If you give business gifts in the course of your trade or business, you can deduct all or part of the costs subject to the following limitations: You deduct no more than $25 of the cost of business gifts you give directly or indirectly to each person during your tax year. If you and your spouse both give gifts to the same person, both of you are treated as one taxpayer. Incidental costs such as engraving, packing or shipping are not included in the $25 limit if they do not add substantial value to the gift. For purposes of the $25 per person limit, do not consider gifts costing $4.00 or less that have your business name permanently engraved on the item and which you distribute on a regular basis. You need to have records that prove the business purpose of the gift as well as the details of the amount spent.
