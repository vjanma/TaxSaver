"You can use Form 1040EZ, Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers With No Dependents, when claiming the earned income credit only if you do not have a qualifying child and your investment income is $3,400 or less (for 2015). Your investment income is the total amount of interest from line 2 of Form 1040EZ and any tax-exempt interest. If you do not meet the requirements for filing Form 1040EZ, you must use Form 1040A or Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return; however, if your investment income is more than $3,400, you cannot claim the earned income credit."
