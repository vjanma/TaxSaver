# This is the threshold for calculating the confidence category (HIGH or LOW). Implementations consider a value 
# above this threshold as HIGH, and below it LOW. Depending on the chosen categorizer, this value may be applied differently 
# (i.e. some categorizers look at more than a single answer's confidence to determine if the threshold is reached)
confidence.threshold=0.80

# Used by the CumulativeConfidenceCategorizer. This determines how many of the top answers
